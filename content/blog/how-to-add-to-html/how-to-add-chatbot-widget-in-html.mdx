### Step 3: Copy the Script Tag
After customizing your chatbot, ChatBuild.io will provide you with a script tag. This script tag is a snippet of code that you’ll need to include in your website to integrate the chatbot. The Script Tag Will Look Something like this:

```html
<div id="chatbot"></div>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bwestwood11/chatbot-widget/bundle/index3.js"></script>
<script>
    Chatbot.mount(document.getElementById('chatbot'), {
        api_key: "your_api_key_will_be_here",
        theme_color: "#2b9348"
    })
    Chatbot.loadCss("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/bwestwood11/chatbot-widget/bundle/index3.css")
</script>
```

### Step 4: Integrate the Script Tag into Your Website
To integrate the chatbot into your website, open your HTML file and paste the script tag just before the closing `</body>` tag. This will ensure that the chatbot widget is loaded when users access your website.
